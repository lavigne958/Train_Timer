# Simple QT based Countdown

This project is only for training purposes, it does **NOT** contain any desing.
It is you choice to desing your app, this is only for the purpose of showing how easy it is to make a countdown timer in Qt.

Branches:
- Master: simple timer, updates every 100 ms (can be changed: must adapt the display though)
- timer_thread: simple timer but the time is running on a dedicated thread, every 100ms (can be changed in timerthread.h: need to adapt display)

I will keep training on Qt on other examples.
